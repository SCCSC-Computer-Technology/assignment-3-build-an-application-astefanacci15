Program ran well althought there is alot of Sort buttons, I believe you coudl have just changed the sort buttons to what they actually do instead of having Just a button that says sort beside some written text.
You have basic error handling in place but it works and eventually could be expanded on to handle more problems
Code is very redable and the UI is very user Friendly. 
Project was neat and I enjoyed playing around with it
