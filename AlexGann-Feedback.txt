Starting with opening the program and trying the UI.

Interface is nice and clean and has a pleasant color scheme.

Sorting options work, though numerical sorts are reversed (descending instead of ascending).

The groupboxes do not have descriptive names, all of them are named 'Sort'. The center group
box's button is also labeled 'Sort' and appears to sort by state name alphabetically, but
gives no other indication that this is intended behavior.

That button and the 'Show' button also show the incorrect state in their popup boxes.
The 'Show' button also does not show the state name.

The reset button does not appear to do anything.

Looking at the code, the first thing to note is that the listBoxStates_SelectedIndexChanged method
throws an exception. 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object.'

There are two tooltip objects set up on the form, but the attempt to set their contents programmatically
appears to have failed.

An OleDbConnection, OleDbDataAdapter, and DataSet are never fully initialized and never used.

Comments are fairly robust on the main form, but the StateInfoForm has none. It would be best to
include comments in all written code.
