Overall, the GUI looked pretty good.
Your code was well structured and easy to follow.
I did have some trouble searching by a specefic state w/
an exception thrown at this line
selectedState = listBoxStates.SelectedItem.ToString();
I would go back and see if you could figure out that issue because
overall the readability and proficiency is fabulous.
8/10
